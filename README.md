# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis – Task 4  
### 📊 Skill Craft Technology | Data Science Internship

---

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing traffic accident data** to identify **hotspots** and understand how **weather**, **road conditions**, and **time of day** influence accident occurrences.  
The analysis and visualizations were built in **Power BI**, leveraging **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔️ Clean and preprocess accident data for accurate insights  
✔️ Analyze patterns across weather, road conditions, and time  
✔️ Visualize accident hotspots using maps  
✔️ Provide actionable insights to improve road safety  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards & visualizations  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning & transformation  
- **Dataset** – Accident data with timestamps, weather, road conditions, and geolocation  

---

## 🔑 Key Steps Performed  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Removed missing/inconsistent values  
- Standardized fields (e.g., "Rain" vs. "Rainy")  
- Converted Date/Time columns to proper formats  

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering  
- Extracted **Hour of Day** from Start Time  
- Created **Time of Day categories**:  
  - 🌅 Morning (5 AM – 12 PM)  
  - ☀️ Afternoon (12 PM – 5 PM)  
  - 🌆 Evening (5 PM – 9 PM)  
  - 🌙 Night (9 PM – 5 AM)  
- Calculated **accident duration** from Start and End times  

### 3️⃣ Visualizations in Power BI  
- 📌 **Bar Charts** – Accidents by weather & road conditions  
- ⏱ **Line Charts** – Accident trends by hour and time of day  
- 🌍 **Map Visuals (Hotspots)** – Geospatial view using latitude & longitude  
- 📊 **Matrix Tables** – Weather vs. Road condition analysis  

---

## 💡 Insights & Outcomes  
🔹 Peak accident hours coincide with **morning and evening rush hours**  
🔹 **Rainy weather and wet roads** significantly increase accident counts  
🔹 Hotspot mapping highlights **high-risk accident zones**, aiding preventive measures
